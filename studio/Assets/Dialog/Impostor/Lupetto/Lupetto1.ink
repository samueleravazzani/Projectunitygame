===answer===
Holding breath for long periods doesn't necessarily increase lung capacity.
Lung capacity is effectively improved through specific respiratory exercises,
such as deep breathing and aerobic activities.
While breath-holding exercises might be part of certain practices,
they are not a direct method for increasing lung capacity and can even be risky if done excessively.
Always consult a healthcare professional before attempting new or intense respiratory exercises.
