===answer===
Holding your breath for extended periods does not necessarily increase your lung capacity.
Lung capacity is more effectively improved through specific respiratory exercises, such as deep breathing and aerobic activities.
While breath-holding exercises might be part of certain practices, they are not a direct method for increasing lung capacity and can even be risky if done excessively.
Always consult with a healthcare professional before attempting new or intense respiratory exercises.
