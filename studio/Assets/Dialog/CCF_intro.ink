Welcome to the Flame Game, where the burning of forest fires due to climate change takes center stage. Amidst widespread discussions and skepticism, the reality remains: climate change is leaving its mark on our environment and daily lives. 

This minigame aims to illuminate the calamity that's devastating the 'Enchanted forest.' Imagine having a water jet ready to extinguish the flames and an intricate maze.
