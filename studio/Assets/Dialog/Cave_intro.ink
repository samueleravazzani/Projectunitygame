Hi there, you finally arrived.
I am Eldrath, the guardian of this magic place.
I was waiting for you.
I know you are the one who can save the world from its problems.
Here on the right you will find an enchanted chest.
It will tell you some enigmas to solve in order to save the world.
Pay attention: you can make only up to 3 mistakes...
...and each time you solve one, you will have to come back there for the next one.
I know you can do it!

    -> END
