  name: Paracetamol
  drug_class: Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs
  drug_indication: In general, it is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain
    and reduction of fever. Because of its low risk of causing allergic reactions,
    this drug can be administered in patients who are intolerant to salicylates and
    those with allergic tendencies, including bronchial asthmatics. Specific dosing
    guidelines should be followed when administering to children.

    that it has been associated with a risk of rare but serious skin reactions.

  enigmas:
  - It can reduce not too strong pain, even for children.
  - This is commonly employed for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and the
    reduction of fever, making it a go-to choice for general pain management.
  - Classified under the Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs class, this is distinctively
    positioned among medications that address pain and inflammation without the use
    of steroids, differentiating it from other classes.
  - A notable advantage is its low risk of causing allergic reactions, allowing administration
    to patients intolerant to salicylates and those with allergic tendencies, including
    individuals with bronchial asthma. This characteristic serves as a key identifier,
    distinguishing it from others with different considerations for allergic reactions.
  - A cautionary note from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) highlights
    a rare but serious risk of skin reactions associated with this. This specific
    warning sets it apart from others without such reported risks.
