  name: Furosemide
  drug_class: Diuretics/Medicine used in heart failure
  drug_indication: 'Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated
    with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including
    the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients. Oral furosemide is
    indicated alone for the management of mild to moderate hypertension or severe
    hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive medications. '
  drug_warnings: It is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can
    lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Excessive diuresis
    may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and
    possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.
    Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of electrolyte imbalance
    and instructed to report to their physicians if weakness, dizziness, fatigue,
    faintness, mental confusion, lassitude, muscle cramps, headache, paresthesia,
    thirst, anorexia, nausea, and/or vomiting occur.
