  m_Name: Furosemide
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  name: Furosemide
  drug_class: Diuretics/Medicine used in heart failure
  drug_indication: 'Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated
    with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including
    the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients. Oral furosemide is
    indicated alone for the management of mild to moderate hypertension or severe
    hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive medications. '
  drug_warnings: It is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can
    lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Excessive diuresis
    may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and
    possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.
    Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of electrolyte imbalance
    and instructed to report to their physicians if weakness, dizziness, fatigue,
    faintness, mental confusion, lassitude, muscle cramps, headache, paresthesia,
    thirst, anorexia, nausea, and/or vomiting occur.

  enigmas:
  - It can be used to treat cardiovascular problems, but may lead to important losses
    of liquids.
  - This takes the spotlight in treating edema associated with congestive heart failure,
    cirrhosis of the liver, and renal diseases, encompassing both adult and pediatric
    patients.
  - Classified under Diuretics and Medicines used in heart failure, this is specifically
    designed to address fluid retention and heart-related issues, setting it apart
    from others with different therapeutic focuses.
  - A potent diuretic, if administered excessively, it can lead to profound diuresis,
    risking water and electrolyte depletion. This cautionary note distinguishes it
    from others with different mechanisms of action or potential side effects.
  - Patients using this should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of electrolyte
    imbalance, including weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and muscle cramps. This emphasis
    on monitoring and reporting specific symptoms serves as a crucial identifier
    for this.
