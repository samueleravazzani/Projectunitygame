  m_Name: Atorvastatin
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  name: Atorvastatin
  drug_class: Antilipemic Agents
  drug_indication: Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of
    dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults,
    hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia,
    and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed
    dietary modifications.
  drug_warnings: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that
    can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin; when
    it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Metformin tablets, USP
    treatment should not be initiated in patients = 80 years of age unless measurement
    of clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients
    are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis.

  enigmas:
  - It reduces the level of lipids in blood, and thus it is not indicated for pregnant
    women.
  - Tailored for the treatment of various dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia
    and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, this has a broad spectrum of use in managing
    lipid-related disorders.
  - As a representative of the Antilipemic Agents class, this is specifically designed
    to address lipid imbalances, setting it apart from drugs with different therapeutic
    focuses such as pain relief or anti-inflammatory effects.
  - A crucial warning stands out, highlighting the contraindication for use in women
    who are pregnant or may become pregnant. This notable precaution helps distinguish
    it from others with different considerations for pregnant individuals.
  - Particularly relevant for adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications,
    this extends its application to treat heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia,
    showcasing its versatility in managing lipid disorders in different age groups.
