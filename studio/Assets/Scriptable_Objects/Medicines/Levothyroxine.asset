  m_Name: Levothyroxine
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  name: Levothyroxine
  drug_class: Thyroid hormones and antithyroid medicines
  drug_indication: Levothyroxine is indicated as replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal),
    secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.
    It is also indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the
    management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.
  drug_warnings: Not for treatment of obesity or for weight loss. Thyroid hormones,
    including Levothyroxine for Injection, should not be used for the treatment of
    obesity or for weight loss. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening
    manifestations of toxicity. However, caution is necessary in interpreting results
    of thyroid function tests in neonates.

  enigmas:
  - Not adapt for people with weight issues, nor for very young people.
  - This primarily serves as replacement therapy for congenital or acquired hypothyroidism,
    with indications spanning primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of thyroid
    dysfunction.
  - Classified outside the realm of treatments for obesity or weight loss, this is
    specifically focused on addressing thyroid-related issues, not pain or inflammation.
  - When it comes to thyroid cancer management, this plays a supportive role as an
    adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy, showcasing its specialized function
    in endocrine health.
  - A noteworthy cautionary note discourages the use of larger doses for weight loss,
    emphasizing the potential for serious or life-threatening toxicity. This distinctive
    warning sets it apart from others with different therapeutic purposes.
