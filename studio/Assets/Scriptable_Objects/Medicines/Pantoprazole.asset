    a history of erosive esophagitis. Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for
    short-term treatment (7-10 days) of patients having gastroesophageal reflux disease
    (GERD) with a history of erosive esophagitis, as an alternative to oral medication
    in patients who are unable to continue taking pantoprazole delayed-release tablets.  '
  drug_warnings: Adverse effects occurring in more than 1% of patients receiving
    oral pantoprazole for up to 8 weeks and more frequently than in those receiving
    placebo include diarrhea and hyperglycemia. There have been spontaneous reports
    of adverse events; angioedema (Quincke's edema); anterior ischemic optic neuropathy;
    severe dermatologic reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson

  enigmas:
  - It is used for stomach problems, but may lead to some contraindication to some
    other parts of the body.
  - Focused on the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history
    of erosive esophagitis, this stands out for its specific indication in managing
    this gastrointestinal condition.
  - As a member of the Antiulcer Agents class, this is tailored for addressing issues
    related to ulcers, setting it apart from medications with different therapeutic
    purposes such as pain relief or anti-inflammatory effects.
  - Watch out for potential adverse effects, with diarrhea and hyperglycemia being
    more common in patients receiving this. This characteristic distinguishes it
    from drugs with different reported side effects
  - Unique warnings highlight rare but serious adverse events, including angioedema,
    anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and severe dermatologic reactions like erythema
    multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These
    specific warnings help differentiate this from others in its class.
